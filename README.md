#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the art of designing, systematic, disciplined and quantifiable approach to the developmet, operation and maintainance of softwares
-It is the engine that drives business decision making 
-It is embedded in all kind of systems like transportation, hospitals, industrial process etc


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The following are 3 key elements of software engineering;
    1. instructions(computer program)-when executed provide desired function and performance
    2. Data-enable program to manipulate information
    3. Documentation-describes operation and use of the programs.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirement analysis -To gather and analysis the software requirements from stakeholders and users
2. Planning -To plan the project scope, resources, timelines and costs
3. System Design -Here is to create a blueprint for the software architeture and design
4. Implementation(Coding) -To write the actual code based on the design document
5. Testing -Here the developer verify that the software works as intended and is free of defect
6. Deployment -To release software to the users or production environment
7. Maintenanc -To provide ongoing supports, updates and improvements to the software


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall model is a linear and sequential approach to software development. Each phase (e.g., requirement analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment) must be completed before the next one begins. Waterfall is appropriate for projects where requirements are well-understood and unlikely to change, such as regulatory or compliance-driven projects. 
For example;  Developing software for a government contract where requirements are fixed, and changes are not permitted once the project starts.
                                WHEREAS
Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to software development. The project is divided into small, manageable units (called sprints or iterations) that are completed in cycles.Agile is ideal for projects where the requirements are expected to change or evolve, such as innovative software products or startups.
For example; Building a mobile app for a startup that needs to quickly adapt to user feedback and market changes.




Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Role: 
A Software Developer is responsible for designing, coding, testing, and maintaining software applications. They translate software requirements into functional code and are involved in various phases of the software development life cycle (SDLC).
Responsibility:
Understanding project requirements, both functional and non-functional, often by collaborating with stakeholders, business analysts, and other team members.

Role of the QA 
A QA Engineer focuses on ensuring the quality and functionality of the software by identifying defects and verifying that the software meets the required standards before it is released. They play a crucial role in maintaining the reliability and usability of the software.
Responsibility:
Developing test plans, test cases, and test scripts based on the requirements and design documents to ensure comprehensive coverage.
Performing manual and automated tests to verify that the software functions as expected under various conditions and scenarios.
Assessing the performance, scalability, and reliability of the software under different load conditions.

Role of the project manager
A Project Manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects. They ensure that the project meets its objectives, is delivered on time, and stays within budget.
Responsibility:
Creating a detailed project plan that outlines the scope, timelines, milestones, resources, and budget required to complete the project.
Acting as the main point of communication between stakeholders.
Keeping the project within its budget by monitoring expenses and making adjustments as needed.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
importance of the IDEs
1. Enhanced Productivity: IDEs provide a unified interface that integrates all the tools a developer needs, such as a code editor, debugger, compiler, and more.
2. IDEs offer features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and real-time error detection, which help developers write clean, bug-free code more quickly. These features can prevent common errors and speed up the development process.
3. Modern IDEs integrate with version control systems, testing frameworks, and deployment tools, creating a seamless development workflow from writing code to deploying it.

importance of VCS
1. Collaboration: VCS allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously without overwriting each otherâ€™s changes. This is crucial for team collaboration, especially in large projects.
2. VCS supports branching, enabling developers to work on new features or bug fixes in isolated environments.
3. VCS serves as a backup system, storing the entire history of the project.



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. challenge: Managing complex and large codebases; As projects grow, codebases can become large and complex, making them difficult to manage, understand, and maintain.
strategies to overcome: To Break down the codebase into smaller, modular components that are easier to manage and test independently.

3. challenge: Security concerns, Ensuring the security of software applications is increasingly important, given the rise in cyber threats and data breaches.
strategies:  Follow security best practices, such as input validation, encryption, and secure authentication, throughout the development process.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing involves testing individual components or modules of a software application in isolation from the rest of the system. Each "unit" typically refers to the smallest testable part of the application, such as a function, method, or class.
importance:- allows developers to catch bugs early in the development process, reducing the cost and complexity of fixing them later.

Integration testing focuses on verifying the interactions between different components or modules of the software system. It ensures that the integrated units work together as intended.
importance:-helps identify issues that may arise when different components interact, such as mismatched data formats, incorrect API calls, or communication failures.

System testing involves testing the complete, integrated system as a whole to ensure it meets the specified requirements. This type of testing validates the end-to-end functionality of the software, including interactions with external systems, databases, and hardware.
importance:- ensures that the software behaves as expected under real-world conditions and meets the functional and non-functional requirements specified in the project documentation.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from the AI models.
it is importance is to avoid getting the confusing answers by making the question clear and specific so that the AI understand what exactly you need


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Forexample, i can prompt "what is AI" instead of "Briefly explain what is and the evolution of AI". The improved prompt is effective because the model will give a brief history and meaningful of what you searching for
